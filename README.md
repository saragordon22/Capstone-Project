# Capstone-Project
Designing an online store
### Description 
The online store capstone project is the first project in my developer portfolio. In the first part of the project, I used HTML and CSS to create an online store. In the second part, I used Javascript to enhance my online store with functionality. The capstone project is an online store, where users can add items from the catalogue into a shopping cart.
