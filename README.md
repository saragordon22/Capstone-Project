# Capstone-Project
Designing an online store
### Description 
The online store capstone project is the first project in my developer portfolio. In the first part of the project, I used HTML and CSS to create an online store. In the second part, I used Javascript to enhance my online store with functionality. The capstone project is an online store, where users can add items from the catalogue into a shopping cart. 
### Installation and Usage
Open the landingpage.html file to access the main page on the website, you can then navigate the other pages from there. Add items from the catalogue page to the basket to see the shopping cart in action.
